# MySQL Database Backup
A library for dumping MySQL databases and creating an archive of their contents.

This package uses [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysqldump.html) under the hood so it has to be installed somewhere on your system. The path is provided inline so it doesn't matter where.

## Documentation
Maybe later.
